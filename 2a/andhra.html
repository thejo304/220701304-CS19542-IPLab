        <h2>History of Andhra Pradesh</h2>
        <p>The state of Andhra Pradesh came into being with the fall of the Satavahana dynasty, which ruled over the Andhra region for about 400 years. The discovery of the inscriptions and rock-cut temples and Chalukyan architectural works at Amaravati are attributed to the period between the 2nd century BCE and the 8th century CE. </p>
        <p>However, several other sites in present-day Andhra Pradesh date back to earlier periods. During this period, the Satavahanas, of Indo-Aryan origin, ruled both Andhra and parts of Maharashtra.</p>
        <p>The old name of Andhra Pradesh is derived from the word “Andhra”, meaning Satavahanas, the most senior kings of Andhra Pradesh and India.</p>
        <h2>The Father of Andhra Pradesh</h2>
        <p>Potti Sreeramulu is known as the father of Andhra Pradesh. He was a Telugu poet and social reformer. He was born on September 17, 1895, in a poor Telugu-speaking family in Thrithala, near Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh, India. He joined the Indian independence movement when he saw the cruel treatment of the people of Hyderabad by the British rulers. </p>
        <p>He supported Nehru’s plan to establish separate states for non-Hindi speaking people as the first step towards self-rule. He later became one of his closest confidants with whom he worked to achieve this measure.</p>
        <p>He sacrificed his life for the cause of a separate Andhra state. In 1952, Potti Sreeramulu fasted until death to protest the discriminatory attitude of the central government towards non-Hindi-speaking states. The fast lasted six weeks. When it became clear that his life was in danger, Nehru rushed him to the hospital. He died two days later, on December 15, 1952.</p>
