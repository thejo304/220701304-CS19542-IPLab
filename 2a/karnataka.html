        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The state of Karnataka may be found in India’s south western region. In terms of wealth, it ranks as one of India’s most prosperous states. With regards to education, enterprise, agriculture, literature and tourism, Karnataka has achieved tremendous progress. Karnataka’s capital is Bengaluru, which is located in the state of Karnataka. Because of its thriving IT industry, Bengaluru has earned the moniker “Silicon Valley of Asia.”</p>
        <p>When the States Reorganisation Act went into force on November 1, 1956, Karnataka was created. Karnataka was named the Mysore State at that time. In 1973, the state was renamed Karnataka. The Kannada Rajyotsava is celebrated on the first day of November each year (Karnataka Formation Day). In celebration of the unification of South India’s Kannada-speaking areas into a single country, this project was completed to mark the occasion. Karnataka’s history wouldn’t be complete without mentioning that day.</p>
        <h2>Geographic and Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>In terms of proximity, Karnataka is India’s seventh-largest state. The city is divided into 30 distinct areas. It is bordered on the western side by the Arabian Sea and Laccadive Sea, the northwestern coast by Goa and the Maharashtra state, and the northern and eastern coasts by Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and the southern coast of Kerala.</p>

        <p>A network of National Highways connects Karnataka to the rest of India and the neighbouring states (NH). There are 153 State Highways connecting the country’s 30 districts (SH). The MDR (Major District Roads) are a key component of district transportation.0</p>
        <p>Thirteen domestic airports and fifteen minor airports in Karnataka serve as gateways to the rest of the world. In addition, the nation has two airports serving military bases and one serving a flight school. The Karnataka cities of Bengaluru and Mangalore both have international airports. The coastal area of Karnataka has one major port and 10 smaller ones. The New Mangalore Port is the state of Karnataka’s principal port.</p>
        <p>The railway community in Karnataka is extensive. In Karnataka, the average length of rail track is 3,089 kilometres. Bangalore, the capital city of the country, now boasts a metro system. The Namma Metro line in Bangalore is being built in segments. Bangalore currently has two metro lines in service.</p>
        <h2>About Bangalore (Capital City)</h2>
        <p>The Indian state of Karnataka’s capital and largest city, Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru), is located in the city of Bengaluru. It is India’s third-most populated city and the fifth-most populous city agglomeration, with a total population of about eight million people. Bangalore, on southern India’s Deccan Plateau, is a city known for its exceptional weather throughout the year. The city is at an elevation of nearly 900 metres (3,000 feet) above sea level. With its status as India’s leading exporter of information technology, Bangalore is commonly referred to as the “Silicon Valley of India” (or the “IT capital of India”). Technology companies in India are concentrated in the cities. In terms of population growth, Bangalore is India’s second-fastest-growing principal town. Bangalore’s metro financial system has been considered either the fourth- or fifth-most effective metro area in India by recent estimations. Many educational and research institutes call it home. The city is home to a large number of state-owned aerospace and defence companies. The Kannada film industry is also based in the city, and it is a popular location for fashion shows.</p>
        <h2>Population and Government</h2>
        <p>The Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council of Karnataka are democratically elected houses in the state’s parliamentary machine of presidency. The 224 members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to serve five-year terms. Seventy-five members of the Legislative Council serve indefinitely, with one-third (25 members) retiring each year.</p>
        <p>Karnataka is home to the Tuluvas, the Kodavas, and the Konkanis. Karnataka is also home to a small number of Tibetan Buddhists and indigenous groups such as the Soligas, Yeravas, Todas, and Siddhis. Traditional folk arts include anything from nomadic troupes to the whole spectrum of music, dance, theatre, and storytelling. Malnad and coastal Karnataka’s ancient dance theatre, Yakshagana, is one of the state’s most important theatrical forms. As Gubbi Veeranna, T.P.Kailasam, B.V. Karanth et al. built the foundations for modern Karnataka theatre with their groundbreaking works, companies like NinaSam, Ranga Shankara, Rangayana, and Prabhat Kalavidaru continue to build upon that legacy with their own work. Doll Kunitha, Veeragase, Kamsale and Kolata dances are some of the most popular in India.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Coastal, hilly (the Western Ghats), plateau (the Karnataka Plateau) and black-soil tract (the northwest) are the four distinct zones of Karnataka. Small alluvial plains and lagoons can be found in the coastal region as it extends northward from the Malabar Coast.</p>
